C++ Bank Management System: Detailed Report*

*1. Introduction:*
This report provides a comprehensive overview of a C++ Bank Management System. The system allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit/withdraw funds, apply for loans, and an admin can update the interest rate.

*2. Design Overview:*
The system is designed using object-oriented principles in C++. It consists of two main classes: Account and BankSystem. Here's a brief overview of each:

- *Account Class:* 
  - Represents a bank account with attributes such as username, password, balance, and loan amount.
  - Provides methods for account operations like deposit, withdrawal, loan application, and password verification.

- *BankSystem Class:*
  - Manages multiple accounts using an unordered map.
  - Implements functionalities for account creation, login, deposit/withdrawal, loan application, and admin operations.
  - Includes an admin menu for updating the interest rate.

*3. Functionalities:*
- *Account Creation:* 
  - Users can create accounts by providing a unique username and password.
  - Prevents creation of accounts with existing usernames.

- *Login:*
  - Users can log in with their username and password.
  - Authentication ensures the validity of credentials.

- *Deposit and Withdrawal:*
  - Account holders can deposit and withdraw funds.
  - Withdrawal is only permitted if the account has sufficient balance.

- *Loan Application:*
  - Users can apply for loans by specifying the loan amount and term.
  - Calculates the total repayment amount based on the loan amount, term, and interest rate.

- *Admin Operations:*
  - Admins can update the interest rate through an admin menu.
  - Provides flexibility in managing the bank's interest policies.

*4. Implementation Details:*
- The system utilizes C++ features like classes, objects, constructors, methods, and control structures.
- Data storage is managed using an unordered map to store account objects, ensuring efficient retrieval and modification.
- User interactions are facilitated through console input and output, making the system user-friendly and accessible.

*5. Future Enhancements:*
- Implementing additional security features such as encryption for sensitive data.
- Incorporating error handling mechanisms to enhance robustness.
- Introducing graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
- Extending functionalities to support transactions between accounts and external bank transfers.

*6. Conclusion:*
The C++ Bank Management System offers a robust platform for managing bank accounts, providing essential functionalities for account holders and administrators alike. With its modular design and extensibility, it serves as a solid foundation for further development and refinement in the realm of banking software applications.
